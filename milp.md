## Frame the Problem

There are three different financial products to choose from:

|Product|Profit|
|-------|------|
|Bond   |5     |
|Stock  |8     |
|Crypto |12    |

There are 4 different people for whom we have to create a portfolio, with the following available funds:

|Person|Money   |
|------|--------|
|Jason |1000000 |
|Julia |200000  |
|Steve |5000000 |
|Lucas |25000   |

We have to build a portfolio for each of them.

Each person has a preference for each product (on a 1-5 scale) based on their risk tolerancy and opinions.

	|Jason|Julia|Steve|Lucas|
|Bond   |4    |2    |1    |3    |
|Stock  |2    |5    |3    |3    |
|Crypto |1    |1    |5    |2    |
